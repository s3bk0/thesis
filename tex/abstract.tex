\chapter*{Abstract}
Decoupling a quantum state from its environment is a key challenge in the quest
for building a quantum computer. 
In semiconductor qubits, the influence of heat transport by phonons 
 originating in control electronics will play a significant role for
the decoherence time of qubits in large scale quantum processors.

This work discusses the concept of a Bragg reflector for coherent
reflection of thermal phonons in order to increase thermal isolation of
semiconductor qubits. For that purpose, a numerical simulation tool is developed
that
can calculate the phonon transmission through such structures using
 the Transfer Matrix Method.
All functionalities are presented with the aim of providing future scientists
with an easy introduction to the use of the code.
The validity of the obtained results is demonstrated by comparing
the results for known configurations.
