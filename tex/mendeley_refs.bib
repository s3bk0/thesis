   abstract = {The optical response of coherent thin-film multilayers is often represented with Fresnel coefficients in a 2 × 2 matrix configuration. Here the usual transfer matrix was modified to a generic form, with the ability to use the absolute squares of the Fresnel coefficients, so as to include incoherent (thick layers) and partially coherent (rough surface or interfaces) reflection and transmission. The method is integrated by use of models for refractive-index depth profiling. The utility of the method is illustrated with various multilayer structures formed by ion implantation into Si, including buried insulating and conducting layers, and multilayers with a thick incoherent layer in an arbitrary position.},

We report the experimental observation of coherent heat conduction through the use of finite-thickness superlattices with varying numbers of periods. The measured thermal conductivity increased linearly with increasing total superlattice thickness over a temperature range from 30 to 150 kelvin, which is consistent with a coherent phonon heat conduction process. First-principles and Green's function-based simulations further support this coherent transport model. Accessing the coherent heat conduction regime opens a new venue for phonon engineering for an array of applications.},

   abstract = {We study theoretically the phonon-induced relaxation and decoherence processes in the hybrid qubit in silicon. A hybrid qubit behaves as a charge qubit when the detuning is close to zero and as a spin qubit for large detuning values. It is realized starting from an electrostatically defined double quantum dot where three electrons are confined and manipulated through only electrical tuning. By employing a three-level effective model for the qubit and describing the environment bath as a series of harmonic oscillators in the thermal equilibrium states, we extract the relaxation and decoherence times as a function of the bath spectral density and of the bath temperature using the Bloch-Redfield theory. For Si quantum dots the energy dispersion is strongly affected by the physics of the valley, i.e., the conduction band minima, so we also included the contribution of the valley excitations in our analysis. Our results offer fundamental information on the system decoherence properties when the unavoidable interaction with the environment is included and temperature effects are considered.},

  abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor 1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits 2-7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 2 53 (about 10 16). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times-our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy 8-14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm. In the early 1980s, Richard Feynman proposed that a quantum computer would be an effective tool with which to solve problems in physics and chemistry, given that it is exponentially costly to simulate large quantum systems with classical computers 1. Realizing Feynman's vision poses substantial experimental and theoretical challenges. First, can a quantum system be engineered to perform a computation in a large enough computational (Hilbert) space and with a low enough error rate to provide a quantum speedup? Second, can we formulate a problem that is hard for a classical computer but easy for a quantum com-puter? By computing such a benchmark task on our superconducting qubit processor, we tackle both questions. Our experiment achieves quantum supremacy, a milestone on the path to full-scale quantum computing 8-14. In reaching this milestone, we show that quantum speedup is achievable in a real-world system and is not precluded by any hidden physical laws. Quantum supremacy also heralds the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technologies 15. The benchmark task we demonstrate has an immediate application in generating certifiable random numbers (S. Aaronson, manuscript in preparation); other initial uses for this new computational capability may include optimization 16,17 , machine learning 18-21 , materials science and chemistry 22-24. However, realizing the full promise of quantum computing (using Shor's algorithm for factoring, for example) still requires technical leaps to engineer fault-tolerant logical qubits 25-29. To achieve quantum supremacy, we made a number of technical advances which also pave the way towards error correction. We},

@report{Cirac2000,
  abstract = {Quantum computers require the storage of quantum information in a set of two-level systems (called qubits), the processing of this information using quantum gates and a means of ®nal readout 1. So far, only a few systems have been identi®ed as potentially viable quantum computer modelsÐaccurate quantum control of the coherent evolution is required in order to realize gate operations, while at the same time decoherence must be avoided. Examples include quantum optical systems (such as those utilizing trapped ions 2±9 or neutral atoms 10±12 , cavity quantum electrodynamics 13±15 and nuclear magnetic resonance 16,17) and solid state systems (using nuclear spins 1,18 , quantum dots 19 and Josephson junctions 20). The most advanced candidates are the quantum optical and nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and we expect that they will allow quantum computing with about ten qubits within the next few years. This is still far from the numbers required for useful applications: for example, the factorization of a 200-digit number requires about 3,500 qubits 21 , rising to 100,000 if error correction 22 is implemented. Scalability of proposed quantum computer architectures to many qubits is thus of central importance. Here we propose a model for an ion trap quantum computer that combines scalability (a feature usually associated with solid state proposals) with the advantages of quantum optical systems (in particular, quantum control and long deco-herence times). Our model considers ions stored in an array of microtraps 23 which can be realized by electric and/or laser ®elds (see Fig. 1). Long-lived internal states of the ions carry the qubits. The main idea is to apply an external ®eld to a particular ion such that its motional wave packet is displaced by a small amount depending on the internal state, analogous to the splitting of the atomic wave packet in atom interferometry. By addressing two neighbouring ions, a differential energy shift due to the Coulomb interaction can be induced, conditional on the state of the two qubits. This implements the two-qubit phase gate required for quantum computation. We emphasize that this mechanism differs fundamentally from our proposal for a quantum computer with trapped ions in a linear trap 2. In that case, the two-qubit gate was based on the exchange of phonons corresponding to the collective centre-of-mass motion of the ions, which initially had to be cooled to zero temperature. In contrast, in our present proposal the motion of the ions is manipulated independently and there is no zero-temperature requirement. This makes the scheme conceptually simpler and obviously scalable. We ®rst explain qualitatively the operation of our model system, followed by a quantitative analysis of the requirements. We consider a set of N ions con®ned in independent harmonic potential wells which are separated by some constant distance d (Fig.},

Two kinds of band-gaps, where the transmission coefficient decays exponentially with the number of unit-cells are specified. The so-called low transmission pass-bands are introduced in order to identify frequency ranges, in which the transmission is sufficiently low for engineering applications, but it does not tend to zero exponentially as the number of unit-cells tends to infinity.

The method was applied to a 40 μm thick porous Si layer of ∼60% porosity, formed on p-type Si of resistivity 1-10 Ω cm. It was found that in the temperature range 20-80 K the thermal conductivity of the studied porous Si layer was more than four orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk crystalline Si, due to phonon confinement in the nanostructured skeleton composing porous Si. The temperature distribution as a function of distance from a heater on the porous Si layer and as a function of depth from the porous Si/metal interface was also calculated for different values of the applied electric power and for two different temperatures, 20 and 290 K, using a combination of experimental results and simulations.

For the materials dominated by corner-shaped pores, the fixed point at which the effective Poisson's ratio (ν) remains constant is at ν0 = 0.2, and J(G) > J(E) > J(K) > J(λ) and J(G) < J(E) < J(K) < J(λ) for materials with ν0 > 0.2 and ν0 < 0.2, respectively. J(Vs) > J(Vp) and J(Vs) < J(Vp) for the materials with ν0 > 0.2 and ν0 < 0.2, respectively. The effective ν increases, decreases and remains unchanged with increasing porosity for the materials with ν0 < 0.2, ν0 > 0.2 and ν0 = 0.2, respectively. For natural rocks containing thin-disk-shaped pores parallel to mineral cleavages, grain boundaries and foliation, however, the ν fixed point decreases nonlinearly with decreasing pore aspect ratio (α: width/length). With increasing depth or pressure, cracks with smaller α values are progressively closed, making the ν fixed point rise and finally reach to the point at ν0 = 0.2.},

  abstract  = {Heat conduction by phonons is a ubiquitous process that incorporates a wide range of physics and plays an essential role in applications ranging from space power generation to LED lighting. Heat conduction has been studied for over two hundred years, yet many of the microscopic details have remained unknown in most crystalline solids, including which phonon-phonon interactions are primarily responsible for thermal resistance and how heat is distributed among the broad thermal spectrum. This lack of knowledge was the result of limitations on the available tools to study heat conduction. However, recent advances in both computation and experiment are enabling an unprecedented microscopic view of thermal transport by phonons in both bulk and nanostructured crystals, from the level of atomic bonding to mesoscopic transport in complex devices. In this topical review, we examine these techniques and the microscopic insights gained into the science and engineering of heat conduction.},

Three optimized acoustic phonon devices were grown by MBE and characterized structurally by x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence: a broadband mirror, a color filter, and an edge filter. The acoustic phonon spectra were studied by Raman scattering in forward and backscattering geometries. We contrast the experimental results with simulations of the Raman spectra using a photoelastic model.

  abstract = {The porosity dependence of the elastic properties of porous silicon in different crystallographic directions is studied. The velocity of longitudinal acoustic waves in porous silicon layers electrochemically etched in (100), (110), and (111) oriented wafers has been measured by acoustic spectroscopy in the gigahertz frequency range. This non-destructive method was used for porous silicon layers with porosity of 25-85 % obtaining velocities in the range of about 1 to 7 km s-1. The implication of constant Poisson's ratio of porous silicon is examined. The effect of velocity dispersion due to multiple scattering is considered. The c11 stiffness constant can be obtained from the velocity measurement in the [100] direction of a cubic crystal. We show that, using the results for velocity in [110] or [111] directions and Keating's relation, the stiffness constants c12 and c44 can be obtained. The velocity dependence on porosity was fitted as v = v0 (1 - φ)κ , where v 0 is the velocity in bulk silicon, φ is porosity, and is a fitting parameter. It is shown that with other conditions being equal: (i) the porosity dependence of the acoustic velocity is related to the doping level of the wafer from which the porous silicon was etched (κ depends on wafer resistivity); (ii) acoustic velocities in different crystallographic directions have the same dependence on porosity (κ is independent of wafer orientation). This requires that all three stiffness constants c 11, c 12 and c 44 have the same dependence on porosity: c ij = cij0 (1 - φ)m; and (iii) the morphology of porous layers depends on the HF concentration in the etchant (κ is used as an indicator for the disorder of the porous structure). © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

The reflectivity can be increased by increasing the number of layers of the mirror to get the required value. For example for an 8 layers Bragg mirror (two layers for each dielectric pair), the contrast of the refractive index has to be equal to 0.275 for reaching reflectivity > 99%. Doubling the number of layers results in a reflectivity of 99.99%. The high reflectivity is purely caused by multiple-interference effects. It can be analyzed by using different matrix methods such as the transfer matrix method (TMM) which is the simplest method to study the characteristic of devices with different alternating layers.},

  abstract = {Quasiballistic heat transfer occurs when there is a temperature gradient over length scales comparable to phonon mean free paths (MFPs). This regime has been of interest recently because observation of quasiballistic transport can lead to useful information about phonon MFPs, knowledge of which is essential for engineering nanoscale thermal effects. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to understand how observations of quasiballistic transport can yield information about MFPs. We solve the transient, one-dimensional, frequency-dependent BTE for a double-layer structure of a metal film on a substrate, the same geometry that is used in transient thermoreflectance experiments, using a frequency-dependent interface condition. Our results indicate that phonons with MFPs longer than the thermal penetration depth do not contribute to the measured thermal conductivity, providing a means to probe the MFP distribution. We discuss discrepancies between our simulation and experimental observations which offer opportunities for future investigation. © 2011 American Physical Society.},
