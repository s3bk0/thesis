   abstract = {Periodic media are routinely used in optical devices and, in particular, photonic crystals to create spectral gaps, prohibiting the propagation of waves with certain temporal frequencies. In one dimension, Bragg structures, also called quarter-wave stacks, are frequently used because they are relatively easy to manufacture and the spectrum exhibits large spectral gaps at explicitly computable frequencies. In this short work, we use variational methods to demonstrate that within an admissible class of pointwise-bounded, periodic media, the Bragg structure uniquely maximizes the first spectral gap-to-midgap ratio. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Scaffolded DNA origami was used to create a stem that penetrated and spanned a lipid membrane, as well as a barrel-shaped cap that adhered to the membrane, in part via 26 cholesterol moieties. In single-channel electrophysiological measurements, we found similarities to the response of natural ion channels, such as conductances on the order of 1 nanosiemens and channel gating. More pronounced gating was seen for mutations in which a single DNA strand of the stem protruded into the channel. Single-molecule translocation experiments show that the synthetic channels can be used to discriminate single DNA molecules.},

Wave transmission and band-gaps due to the material gradation and incident wave-field are investigated. A classification of band-gaps in layered phononic crystals is proposed. The classification relies on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix for a unit-cell and the asymptotics derived for the transmission coefficient. Two kinds of band-gaps, where the transmission coefficient decays exponentially with the number of unit-cells are specified. The so-called low transmission pass-bands are introduced in order to identify frequency ranges, in which the transmission is sufficiently low for engineering applications, but it does not tend to zero exponentially as the number of unit-cells tends to infinity. A polyvalent analysis of the geometrical and physical parameters on band-gaps is presented. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Porous Si thermal conductivity was determined in a wide temperature range from 20 to 350 K using the steady-state direct current method and a subsequent finite element method. The method was applied to a 40 μm thick porous Si layer of ∼60% porosity, formed on p-type Si of resistivity 1-10 Ω cm. It was found that in the temperature range 20-80 K the thermal conductivity of the studied porous Si layer was more than four orders of magnitude lower than that of bulk crystalline Si, due to phonon confinement in the nanostructured skeleton composing porous Si. The temperature distribution as a function of distance from a heater on the porous Si layer and as a function of depth from the porous Si/metal interface was also calculated for different values of the applied electric power and for two different temperatures, 20 and 290 K, using a combination of experimental results and simulations. The effectiveness of local thermal isolation from the Si substrate by a thick highly porous Si layer in a wide temperature range was demonstrated, showing that this material is challenging for use in Si micro-cooling devices. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The characteristic J values of the GMR for E, G, K and λ of each material are systematically different and display consistent correlations with the Poisson's ratio of the nonporous material (ν0). For the materials dominated by corner-shaped pores, the fixed point at which the effective Poisson's ratio (ν) remains constant is at ν0 = 0.2, and J(G) > J(E) > J(K) > J(λ) and J(G) < J(E) < J(K) < J(λ) for materials with ν0 > 0.2 and ν0 < 0.2, respectively. J(Vs) > J(Vp) and J(Vs) < J(Vp) for the materials with ν0 > 0.2 and ν0 < 0.2, respectively. The effective ν increases, decreases and remains unchanged with increasing porosity for the materials with ν0 < 0.2, ν0 > 0.2 and ν0 = 0.2, respectively. For natural rocks containing thin-disk-shaped pores parallel to mineral cleavages, grain boundaries and foliation, however, the ν fixed point decreases nonlinearly with decreasing pore aspect ratio (α: width/length). With increasing depth or pressure, cracks with smaller α values are progressively closed, making the ν fixed point rise and finally reach to the point at ν0 = 0.2.},

Heat conduction has been studied for over two hundred years, yet many of the microscopic details have remained unknown in most crystalline solids, including which phonon-phonon interactions are primarily responsible for thermal resistance and how heat is distributed among the broad thermal spectrum. This lack of knowledge was the result of limitations on the available tools to study heat conduction. However, recent advances in both computation and experiment are enabling an unprecedented microscopic view of thermal transport by phonons in both bulk and nanostructured crystals, from the level of atomic bonding to mesoscopic transport in complex devices. In this topical review, we examine these techniques and the microscopic insights gained into the science and engineering of heat conduction.},

The velocity of longitudinal acoustic waves in porous silicon layers electrochemically etched in (100), (110), and (111) oriented wafers has been measured by acoustic spectroscopy in the gigahertz frequency range. This non-destructive method was used for porous silicon layers with porosity of 25-85 % obtaining velocities in the range of about 1 to 7 km s-1. The implication of constant Poisson's ratio of porous silicon is examined. The effect of velocity dispersion due to multiple scattering is considered. The c11 stiffness constant can be obtained from the velocity measurement in the [100] direction of a cubic crystal. We show that, using the results for velocity in [110] or [111] directions and Keating's relation, the stiffness constants c12 and c44 can be obtained. The velocity dependence on porosity was fitted as v = v0 (1 - φ)κ , where v 0 is the velocity in bulk silicon, φ is porosity, and is a fitting parameter. It is shown that with other conditions being equal: (i) the porosity dependence of the acoustic velocity is related to the doping level of the wafer from which the porous silicon was etched (κ depends on wafer resistivity); (ii) acoustic velocities in different crystallographic directions have the same dependence on porosity (κ is independent of wafer orientation). This requires that all three stiffness constants c 11, c 12 and c 44 have the same dependence on porosity: c ij = cij0 (1 - φ)m; and (iii) the morphology of porous layers depends on the HF concentration in the etchant (κ is used as an indicator for the disorder of the porous structure). © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

The reflectivity can be increased by increasing the number of layers of the mirror to get the required value. For example for an 8 layers Bragg mirror (two layers for each dielectric pair), the contrast of the refractive index has to be equal to 0.275 for reaching reflectivity > 99%. Doubling the number of layers results in a reflectivity of 99.99%. The high reflectivity is purely caused by multiple-interference effects. It can be analyzed by using different matrix methods such as the transfer matrix method (TMM) which is the simplest method to study the characteristic of devices with different alternating layers.},

This regime has been of interest recently because observation of quasiballistic transport can lead to useful information about phonon MFPs, knowledge of which is essential for engineering nanoscale thermal effects. Here, we use the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to understand how observations of quasiballistic transport can yield information about MFPs. We solve the transient, one-dimensional, frequency-dependent BTE for a double-layer structure of a metal film on a substrate, the same geometry that is used in transient thermoreflectance experiments, using a frequency-dependent interface condition. Our results indicate that phonons with MFPs longer than the thermal penetration depth do not contribute to the measured thermal conductivity, providing a means to probe the MFP distribution.
