@article{Fomenko2014,
  abstract  = {In-plane wave propagation in layered phononic crystals composed 
  of functionally graded interlayers arisen from the solid diffusion of 
  homogeneous isotropic materials of the crystal is considered. Wave transmission 
  and band-gaps due to the material gradation and incident wave-field are 
  investigated. A classification of band-gaps in layered phononic crystals is 
  proposed. The classification relies on the analysis of the eigenvalues of the 
  transfer matrix for a unit-cell and the asymptotics derived for the transmission 
  coefficient. Two kinds of band-gaps, where the transmission coefficient decays 
  exponentially with the number of unit-cells are specified. The so-called low 
  transmission pass-bands are introduced in order to identify frequency ranges, 
  in which the transmission is sufficiently low for engineering applications, 
  but it does not tend to zero exponentially as the number of unit-cells tends 
  to infinity. A polyvalent analysis of the geometrical and physical parameters 
  on band-gaps is presented. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
